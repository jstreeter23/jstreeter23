### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Jordan**, a Salesforce Administrator & Software Engineering student based in Los Angeles, California.

I have a passion for building solutions, automating workflows, designing systems, and exploring new technologies.

Laziness is my greatest superpoewer. If there is a way to optimize a process, I will do it. Making things fast and efficient.

My favorite language is **Python**. I am proficient with the **Salesforce Lightning Web Component** framework (heavy on JavaScript) and I am currently learning **React** alongside my coursework.

My daily tools include **Cursor** (my main IDE), **Google Colab** for data analysis, **Penpot** for frontend design, and **Make** for simple automations. I keep my life organized in **Notion** and use **Mimo** for extra coding reps.

### Fun Facts:

* I used to be a substitute teacher 🍎

* **Hobbies:** Basketball - Go Lakers! Cooking & Gym.
