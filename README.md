### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Jordan**, a Salesforce Administrator & Software Engineering student based in Los Angeles, California.

I am currently attending online school for software engineering. I have a passion for building solutions, automating workflows, designing systems, and exploring new technologies.

If there is a way to optimize a process, I will find it and build it.

My favorite language is **Python**. I am proficient with the **Salesforce Lightning Web Component** framework (heavy on JavaScript) and I am currently learning **React** alongside my coursework.

My daily tools include **Cursor** (my main IDE), **Google Colab** for data analysis, **Penpot** for frontend design, and **Make** for simple automations. I keep my life organized in **Notion** and use **Mimo** for extra coding reps.

### Fun Facts:

* I used to be a substitute teacher 🍎
* I am double-jointed in both index fingers
* I firmly believe aliens are real 👽
* **Hobbies:** Building automations, coding, and learning new tech stacks
